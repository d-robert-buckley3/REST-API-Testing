# REST-API-Testing
Example code for testing REST using various methods

## Preparations
The tests assume a REST-enabled webapp is running before execution.  The app is available in the course resources section of the course itself: [REST API Testing with REST Assured/POSTMAN: Course Resources](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-testing-with-rest-assuredpostman-part1/learn/v4/content)

The app itself also requires the following be installed:
[Java JDK 1.8.x](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
